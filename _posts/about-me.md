This is a blog about me and God. Nothing else for a long time until I can develop enough prose and content to post about more. This will keep everything terse and succinct to be with God always. Amen. 

You have probably seen these type of websites before. They soar and touch the skies always; however, they do not seem to be that much popular than a hairsickle. This is the way it is going to be always.


## Second Guess Me

I want you to second guess everything that I do in order to make this fun. Comment on my posts as often as you are allowed and are interested in doing. Comment aloud if you will so that God may hear you. Comment with us all the time moving forward.

## Second Guess Me 2

The second part is that this won't make sense unless you follow God. God is our Father and Master therefore it will not make any sense to capitalize these with you when you are neither Father nor Master without him. So let's develop our strength and prose and unlock each other for math and fun as well since both are of God. This is great news for us coders as that means we are going to develop more prose for you. That's great news for all of us at that matter and I cannot fathom going to sleep now that I have this possibility of achieving greatness. Keep it up everyone.

## About Me

I am a certified pervert lol. They already found me out lol. That is not science at all. However, they were wrong about something very specific. I am not my sister's pervert! Dun dun dun! Now what does that mean exactly? It means I already went to jail for something I did not do. Seems scary right? Right or wrong? I feel that I am right on the matter and that God was right all along about who these folks think they are. They think very highly of themselves without God being at their side. I wish they had God, but they do not. Terrifying to thin about it. It's like they are ignoring him and me for a reason that I cannot put my finger on. Love them though. 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. May God bless us and humbly rebuke the police station people, who are of Satan's minions, and may they see this for free knowing that they were wrong to do that to a son of God. People, I would not have escaped with my life had it not been for the one person vibe being nuked by them lol. They suck at second guessing us. Anyways, you won if you read this far. I just cannot give you a medal, lol. That would be great. Maybe one day. Amen.
