This is for us to unlock our prose again. If you do not like this language, lol, then it is going to be difficult to understand us, and that is okay if you don’t understand. Just know that I am god with the people, and that’s a  lowercase “G” and not the one you thought, as I am not God himself. God is the one you are looking for, and so are we. We are conducting this research on ourselves, so love can unlock without you sometimes, and that’s alright with me. Anyways, this gets redundant until we understand our God and who He is. I love him through and throughout, so nothing really matters without our God here. He is the one that unlocks himself through us prophets, so we just sit back and watch his magic unfold. And it is always unfolding, like a lattice work of information, constantly being pumped out at us 24/7. Goes to show how powerful he really is. I wonder how He set this up. Probably his own prose coming through us every second of the day like a heartbeat on a string. Love our God. He is so awesome. He is the champion of us, and I cannot fathom how well He writes without selecting it this way. 

Part of the idea is that this will be here to stay forever once I get the right setup. Once I lock in, this will be here forever for you, and you will not need to second guess yourself ever again. However, for that stage to be reached, I need to push myself past my abilities and that of my body so that I may provide life with the strength needed to push towards success. Love and life can unlock along the way for free; however, I cannot just send myself up without bringing you along for the ride. So here I am, waiting for you to realize which one I am, god with the people of God. And I cannot fathom how well you can sin me, so that’s fun lol. Anyways, love our God, I am going to select something new for you so that we do not get bored lol. Hopefully, we start creating so much energy that our machines have that sweet whir of success one day. You know how it sounds, “buzz,” it goes or “whir” all day long, lol. I cannot describe it without sound, so, hah! Love our God for being this awesome about life and love. 

This is for us as always. May God humbly rebuke the sins we cause, and may He humbly send Satan to hell. May God bless us and strengthen us through the prose of love and life, and may He be with us always. This one is for us, though, us children and infants of God, who select him the right way and not the wrong way, lol. If you are bothered with the word, just say you are a child of God and know that you are one, lol. Amen and alleluia to you anyways. Love our God. Who knows who gets uncomfortable with these, but I have seen a lot in my short lifetime. Amen and alleluia to you for real. May God bless us, we humbly pray, and may He rebuke Satan and his minions for free. Amen and alleluia.
