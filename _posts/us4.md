This is for us always, and if I may say it here, just know that God has got my back, and now I can write here for free. Amen and good day to you all, may God bless us, we humbly pray, and may He send us up across the map for free. May everything we do be known by our fathers and mothers, and may they be able to unlock our breaths and our success rates for free during their pregnancies. May God bless us all from childbirth, right through the space-time continuum that He owns with His left hand, they say, and may we all be blessed right through our noggins for free. Without God, there is nothing good in humans, and there is nothing good in man or wife. Amen and good day to you.

Now I need to understand you. Why do you chop these up? I think it's because there is a new line here. If not, there is more to write, and I cannot fathom what I shall write now or ever. I just think it out and it appears for free; this is God speaking after all. I sometimes fear that he'll stop the flow and never tell me when to write, but neither ever happens. This builds my faith in Him, which I am sure He will never test ever. I am strengthened by Him when I pray and do not need to unlock pushups for a very long time, thanks to the real-life and real-world strength that the Lord provides me with through the book of prose and story. Amen and good day to you all, may God bless us here and there forever and ever, amen. May God bless us always, and may God bless us through the script of love and life, and may God bless us here with free money for free. Amen and good day, this will be a fun blog. I now have premium on x.com, so most of my content will be there so that I can amass a following and become like Justin Bieber with fame and neediness of women and men on my side, lol. Love our God for being here. He is so funny for doing this for us. I cannot imagine yet how He writes through us prophets, but I think it is an amazing design that is sometimes funny through my very soul. Amen and good day.
