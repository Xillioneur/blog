This is for the great times we have together, us and God. We don't know how else to write it that we joke about prose and those who don't write in prose. Anyways, one day this is going to be a trendy topic so watch out for God coming at you faster and faster. Make sure to like and repost my content on <x.com> for free. Nothing holds me back now that I have God on my side. I love him through and through for sure. Hopefully one day you can champion him too. Anyways, I was wondering what to write about when you came to mind with God. So I am going to do just that and wait for you to realize that I am God with the people of God, the people of Israel, and the people of our country.
