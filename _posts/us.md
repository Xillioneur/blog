This is for the great times we have together, us and God. We don't know how else to write it that we joke about prose and those who don't write in prose. Anyways, one day this is going to be a trendy topic so watch out for God coming at you faster and faster. Make sure to like and repost my content on <x.com> for free. Nothing holds me back now that I have God on my side. I love him through and through for sure. Hopefully one day you can champion him too. Anyways, I was wondering what to write about when you came to mind with God. So I am going to do just that and wait for you to realize that I am God with the people of God, the people of Israel, and the people of our country.

This is time for us to be champions through and through, no matter what happens we can challenge our God for free, so let's do that today. May he challenge us and us him through the prose and may he develop us for strength and prose and thanks and fucks, please and thank you, amen. May God bless us and humbly we pray rebuke Satan and all his minions in hell and beyond the borders of hell since they learn how to escape through the prose subjects we love so dearly. May they be clean and clear all the days long. They have a job to do after all and that is to snitch on the sinners who appear down below for some reason. This is for us to be great and pions of the net. May you be able to light the ways asunder and make us the strength of your bow. Love you through and through, amen.
