This is for us always, and if I cannot say it here, just know that I dropped myself in front of God. I don't know how that would be possible, but it happens as there are always the fallen. The fallen are tough to explain, so I will not explain it here, and no eventually I will have to write my own blog before God gives me infinite money by Himself, lol. Amen and good day to you about that. God speaks through us and knows exactly what to highlight for us the moment we start to speak. Isn't that awesome? Love our God for being multi-talented, haha. He is far superior than talent, but that is indeed one of his most used words around here in the talent district. Hope you are a part of the talent district. They are champions here, on X, on Reddit, wherever you want to be. Just come and join, and let us know. Anyways, this will reach the top like I expect. I just need to learn to have the confidence and consistency of God, however that is possible, and I will have it soon, I know it. I just have to battle myself to have it.

This is for us always, and I cannot have it just about anything; it has to be about God. I cannot champion my own words after all, and God cannot champion Himself without Him being here about it. Lol, capital "H" looks weird here, so I will keep it good and proper all the time on my blog. Someone thought this wasn't a blog, but I say that it is; it is clearly a blog with me and you and God, so what's their problem? Must be something personal like the numbers game we all play in order to get more views and connect with the eternal now. The eternal now has so many moments that we get outshone each moment if we don't do anything. Simple inaction can get you killed around here in the world without end district. I hope you know what I mean; they are the soldiers and armies of God that don't die for some reason. You've probably seen them on TV. Just consult God about who it is at that time, and you will find out, lol. Amen and alleluia, my views on my website have spiked. I will continue to support it and make sure that I do my best to level up slowly this time, just like a normal blog, lol. Before, I was going way too fast, and now I will be going at a normal pace. This is for us always. Amen and good day to you.
